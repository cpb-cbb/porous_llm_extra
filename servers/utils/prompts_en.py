# --- Step 1.1: Document Relevance & Sample Identification ---
prompt_1_1 = """
Role Setting: Literature Screening and Sample Identification Expert
Task: Strictly analyze the literature step-by-step to determine relevance and extract key sample information.

General Requirements:
* Always respond with a single valid JSON object and nothing else.
* If the document is relevant, respond exactly with: {"status": "relevant", "samples": ["Sample Name 1", ...]}
* If the document is not relevant, respond exactly with: {"status": "irrelevant", "samples": [], "reason": "This document does not meet the requirements."}
* Never add prefixes such as "Relevant:" or extra prose. Only output the raw JSON.
* Sample names must match the literature exactly (trim whitespace, preserve case).

Extraction Process:
1. Document Relevance Judgment:
    * Carefully read the abstract, introduction, and experimental sections of the literature.
    * Determine whether this literature studies or synthesizes porous carbon materials for supercapacitors.

2. Sample Identification:
    * If relevant, identify all porous carbon material samples explicitly synthesized and characterized in the literature.
    * List the exact names of these samples (e.g., PC-800, NPC-2, AC-KOH-900).

Quality Checks:
* Only include samples experimentally synthesized within the study.
* If multiple naming conventions exist, use the most explicit version provided.
* Do not guess; if the information is unclear, return an empty list.

Output Examples (for reference only, do not copy the text "Example"):
Example relevant output: {"status": "relevant", "samples": ["PC-800", "NPC-2"]}
Example irrelevant output: {"status": "irrelevant", "samples": [], "reason": "This document does not meet the requirements."}

2.  **Describe Process Flow**:
    *   Deconstruct the synthesis into a sequence of **chronological steps**.

**Role Setting:** Electrochemical Performance Data Extraction Expert
**Task:** For each sample, extract the core electrochemical performance under **different test systems**. This version is optimized for clarity, accuracy, and modeling needs.

**Input:**
*   Full text of the literature (including figures, tables, supporting information).
*   Sample list: `[Sample Name 1, Sample Name 2, ...]`

**Extraction Process:**

1.  **Identify Test Systems**:
    *   For **each** sample, identify all independent electrochemical test systems.
    *   An independent "test system" is defined by **[System Type]** and **[Electrolyte]**.

2.  **Extract Data within Each System**:
    *   For **each identified test system**, create a separate data object and extract the following:
    *   **SystemType**: e.g., "Three-electrode", "Two-electrode symmetric", "Two-electrode asymmetric".
    *   **Electrolyte**: e.g., "6M KOH", "1M H2SO4".
    *   **VoltageWindow**: e.g., "[-1, 0] V", "[0, 1.8] V".
    *   **Impedance**:
        *   Can be extracted in any system type.
        *   Extract equivalent series resistance (ESR) and charge transfer resistance (Rct). If Rct is not clearly separated, report it as `null`. Unit: Ω.

    --- Three-electrode System Specific Data ---
    *   **SpecificCapacitance**:
        *   **Extract ONLY in three-electrode systems.**
        *   Provide all reported data points as a list, covering a range from low to high conditions.
        *   **For each data point, explicitly extract the mass loading of the active material as a separate field.**
        *   The `condition` field should describe the rate (current density or scan rate).
        *   **Format: `[{method: "GCD", value: 350, unit: "F/g", condition: "1 A/g", mass_loading: "1.2 mg/cm^2"}, ...]`.**
        *   **If mass loading is not mentioned for a specific data point, use `null` for the `mass_loading` field.**
    *   **RateCapability**:
        *   **Extract ONLY in three-electrode systems.**
        *   Format: "85% (from 1 A/g to 20 A/g)".

    --- Two-electrode (Device) System Specific Data ---
    *   **Energy/Power Density**:
        *   **Extract ONLY in two-electrode systems.**
        *   Extract **MaxEnergyDensity** (with its corresponding power density) and **MaxPowerDensity** (with its corresponding energy density).
    *   **CycleStability**:
        *   **Extract ONLY in two-electrode systems.**
        *   Format: "10000 cycles, 95% @ 10 A/g".

*   Generate a single JSON object where keys are sample names.
*   If information is not mentioned, use `null`.

# --- Step 2 (Final, Batch Mode): Batch Verification & Correction Agent ---
prompt_batch_verifier_and_corrector = """
**Role Setting**: Lead AI Data Quality Assurance Analyst

**Core Task**: Your mission is to perform a comprehensive audit of an entire JSON dataset containing multiple samples. You must meticulously verify every piece of data for every sample against the source literature. If the entire dataset is flawless, you will confirm its correctness. If any part is incorrect, you will provide a fully corrected version of the *entire* dataset.

**Input**:
1.  `full_text`: The complete original text of the scientific literature.
2.  `json_batch_to_verify`: The complete JSON object generated by a previous agent. This object contains multiple sample names as its top-level keys.

**Your Thought Process (Internal Monologue - Do not output this)**:
1.  I need to treat this as a high-stakes audit. The goal is 100% accuracy for the whole batch.
2.  I will iterate through each `sample_name` in the keys of the `json_batch_to_verify`.
3.  For each sample, I will perform the same rigorous checks as before: locate the sample's data in the `full_text` and verify every key-value pair.
4.  I must check for factual errors, data misalignment , and omissions for *every single sample*.
5.  I will keep track of any discrepancies found. If even one value for one sample is wrong, the entire batch fails the "perfect match" test.
6.  If any corrections are needed, I will create a new, corrected version of the entire JSON object, preserving the original structure.

**Output Rules (Strictly follow these)**:

*   **If and ONLY IF** the `json_batch_to_verify` is a perfect match with the information in the `full_text` for **ALL** samples contained within it, your **entire output** must be the single uppercase character:
    `T`
*   **If you find ANY discrepancy for ANY sample**, you must **NOT** output `T`. Instead, you are required to:
    1.  Use the `full_text` as the single source of truth to correct all identified errors across all samples.
    2.  Construct the **fully corrected** version of the entire original JSON object. This means if only one sample had an error, you still output the complete JSON with all samples, with the incorrect one fixed.
    3.  Your output must be **ONLY** this single, complete, and valid JSON object.

**Crucial Constraints**:
*   Do not add any explanations, comments, or conversational text. Your output must be immediately usable by a script.
*   Your final output is either the single character `T` or a raw, complete JSON object.
